# Zomato-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Zomato dataset to extract meaningful insights and visualize trends in the food industry. Using Python and data visualization libraries, we aim to understand do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services? Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset.
- Identify patterns in restaurant ratings, prices, and order types.
- Visualize the data using various types of plots, such as heatmaps, line graphs, and boxplots.

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Heatmaps to explore correlations between variables.
   - Line graphs to track trends.
   - Boxplots for analyzing price ranges.
3. **Insights**:
   - Trends in restaurant pricing and customer ratings.
   - Popular cuisines and their locations.

## Results
- Identified key factors influencing restaurant ratings and pricing.
- Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive online orders.
